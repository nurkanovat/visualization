# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

This data visualization has several issues that make it a bad example:

1. The heights of the bars do not accurately represent the values. The bar for 77.6% is significantly shorter than the bar for 19.3%, which is highly misleading as the higher percentage should be represented by a taller bar.

2. The scaling of the bars is inconsistent. The difference between 2.1% and 19.3% is not proportionally represented compared to the difference between 19.3% and 77.6%.

3. The use of large icons (faces) on top of the bars can distract viewers from the actual data being presented. This can lead to misinterpretation of the data.

4. While the colors are distinct, the choice of colors (red, blue, green) along with the emoticon faces may convey an emotional bias. Red often suggests negativity, blue neutrality, and green positivity, which might influence the viewer's interpretation.

5. The graph lacks a clear legend or context for what the data represents. While the question at the top asks about satisfaction with the election results, more context or a clear title would help viewers understand what the percentages represent.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
To improve this data visualization, we can concider the following changes:
1. Ensure that the heights of the bars are proportional to the values they represent.

2. Use a consistent scale for the y-axis to accurately represent the differences in values. This will help viewers to easily compare the percentages.

3. Remove the large emoticon faces or minimize their size to ensure they do not distract from the actual data. The focus should be on the data, not the icons.
    
4. Use neutral colors to avoid any emotional bias. For example, shades of the same color (e.g., light blue, medium blue, dark blue) can be used to represent different percentages without implying any positive or negative connotations.
    
5. Add clear labels and a legend to explain what the bars represent. Ensure the axis is labeled, and consider adding grid lines to help viewers gauge the values.

This data visualization is a good example for several reasons:

1. It provides a thorough and multifaceted view of the data, covering seasonal changes, yearly variations, and averages, allowing the viewer to understand the data from different perspectives.

2. The title "How does milk nutrition vary depending on season?" is clear and descriptive, giving the audience immediate insight into what the visualization is about.

3. Different colors are used effectively to represent different seasons and variations, making it easy to distinguish between data points and understand trends.

4. The layout is well-structured with a clear visual hierarchy, guiding the viewer's eye from the important central metric (average protein content) to more detailed seasonal and yearly variations.

5. Different types of charts (circular chart for seasonal changes, line chart for yearly variations, and bar chart for average values) are used together to present the data in a comprehensive manner. Each chart type is chosen appropriately for the data it represents.

6. The visualization includes annotations and labels that provide additional context and explanation. For instance, the average protein percentage is prominently displayed, and the legend explains the color coding for the months.

7. The visualization provides detailed data over a long period (1994-2015), which helps in identifying long-term trends and patterns.

8. This visualization is interactive and allow users to explore the data in more detail, such as hovering over data points for exact values or filtering by year or season.

9. The design is visually engaging, with the circular chart in the center drawing the viewer's attention and inviting further exploration of the surrounding data.

10. The data is presented clearly and precisely, with all elements well-defined and easy to interpret. Overall, this visualization effectively communicates complex data in an accessible and engaging manner, making it a strong example of good data visualization practices.


- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
